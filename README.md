# Embracing Enums

In January 2020, I delivered a conference talk titled "Enums: The Missing Data Type",  which ended on a sour note: PHP probably would not have a native type for handling enumerations any time soon. To my surprise and delight, PHP 8.1 would release with a new "Enum" type less than two years later. Now we can really explore enumerations: both the theory behind them and the current PHP implementation. Weâ€™ll cover how representing things like statuses with enums improves immutability, readability, and type safety; the different types of enums available to us; and address the most common questions around the current limitations of enums.
